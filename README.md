**LAB** **5** **On-site programming of team projects**

 

**Task**

The on-site programming requires the development of a oral calculation program, which covers students of all ages in primary schools and improves the quick calculation ability of pupils' addition and subtraction (multiplication and division).

**Functional requirement**

\1. Applicable age range of oral calculation software: primary school students of all ages (primary school grade 1 to primary school grade 6);

\2. Different difficulty levels are set according to students of different ages. The difficulty levels are as follows:

​		a) Grade 1 to grade 2: addition and subtraction of integers within 100;

​		b) Grades 3 to 4: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers;

​		c) Grades 5 to 6: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division including decimals.

\3. The test questions are automatically and randomly generated by the software;

\4. The number of test questions is determined by the user;

\5. After the answer is finished, the software automatically judges the user's scores.

**Reference sample**
